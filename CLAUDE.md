## ðŸ“¦ Progressive Transcription Architecture

### Three-Layer System

1. **Instant Layer**: Web Speech API (0ms start, online-only)
2. **Tiny Layer**: 20MB distil-tiny loads invisibly (2-3s)
3. **Target Layer**: Auto-selected based on device RAM:
   - <3GB RAM: distil-small (83MB)
   - â‰¥3GB RAM: distil-medium (166MB)
   - Pro mode: distil-large-v3 (750MB, 9+ languages)

### Key Features

- **WebGPU Ready**: 10-100x speed boost when available
- **Offline-first**: All models run locally after download
- **Smart caching**: Models persist across sessions
- **Progressive enhancement**: Quality improves invisibly

## Build & Development

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Vite HMR
- `npm run build` - Production build with optimizations
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run format` - Run Prettier formatter
- `npm run lint` - ESLint + Prettier checks
- `npm run lighthouse` - Performance audit

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Framework**: Use idiomatic Svelte patterns; this is a SvelteKit project
- **JavaScript**: Standard JS (not TypeScript) with JSConfig for minimal type checking
- **Formatting**: Prettier with svelte and tailwind plugins
- **CSS**: Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI components
- **Naming**: Use descriptive camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components
- **Imports**: Use ES modules syntax, group imports by type
- **Error Handling**: Avoid window reference errors in SSR context
- **Component Structure**: Organize by functionality in lib/components
- **Services**: External API interactions belong in lib/services
- **Documentation**: Include JSDoc comments for functions
- **Reactivity**: Use Svelte's reactive declarations and statements properly

## Ghost Component System

The Ghost component is the heart of TalkType's personality:

### Key Features

- **Reactive theming**: 4 themes (peach, mint, bubblegum, rainbow)
- **State animations**: Wobbles when recording, blinks periodically
- **SVG-based**: Scalable, performant, delightful
- **Eye tracking**: Follows cursor subtly

### Animation States

- **Idle**: Gentle breathing effect
- **Recording**: Wobble animation
- **Processing**: Pulse effect
- **Wake up**: Special blink sequence

For detailed implementation, see `/src/lib/components/ghost/README.md`

## ðŸ’° Payment Model & Marketing Philosophy

### "DLC Already on Disc" Approach

// The entire Pro feature set is already built and deployed to every user
// Payment ($9 one-time) simply flips a boolean to unlock features
// This approach provides several benefits:

- **Zero latency unlock**: Features activate instantly upon payment
- **Try before buy**: Users can experience the free tier fully
- **No server dependency**: Payment validation happens once, features work forever
- **Ethical pricing**: One-time $9 unlock vs competitors' $10+/month subscriptions

### Key Marketing Points

### Technical Advantages for Marketing

// These can be simplified for user-facing copy:

- **Distil-Whisper models**: 6x faster, 50% smaller than regular Whisper
- **WebGPU ready**: 10-100x speed improvements when browsers enable it
- **Progressive transcription**: Web Speech â†’ Tiny â†’ Optimal model pipeline
- **Device-aware**: Automatically adjusts to available memory/compute
