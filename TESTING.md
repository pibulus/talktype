# TalkType Testing Strategy

## Overview

We've simplified our testing approach from a 3,200-line custom test suite to a standard Vitest setup with ~200 lines of focused tests.

## Test Stack

- **Vitest**: Fast unit testing framework
- **@testing-library/svelte**: Component testing utilities
- **happy-dom**: Lightweight DOM implementation for tests
- **@vitest/ui**: Interactive test UI (optional)

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test          # Run all tests once
npm run test:ui   # Open interactive UI
npm run test:watch # Watch mode for development
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
```

## Test Structure

```
src/
├── lib/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── ghost/
│   │       ├── Ghost.svelte
│   │       └── Ghost.test.js    # Component tests
│   └── utils/
│       └── math.test.js         # Utility tests
└── test-setup.js                 # Global test configuration
```

## Writing Tests

### Unit Tests

Test pure functions and utilities:

```javascript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

describe('Utility Function', () => {
	it('performs expected calculation', () => {
		expect(myFunction(2, 3)).toBe(5);
	});
});
```

### Component Tests (Svelte 5 Note)

Due to Svelte 5 compatibility issues with @testing-library/svelte, component testing requires special handling. For now, focus on:

- Unit testing business logic extracted from components
- Integration testing via E2E tests (future)
- Testing utility functions and services

## Test Philosophy

- **User-focused**: Test behavior, not implementation
- **Minimal**: Keep tests simple and maintainable
- **Fast**: Tests should run in seconds, not minutes
- **Reliable**: No flaky tests - if it fails, it's a real issue

## Migration from Custom Test Suite

### Before (3,200 lines)

- Custom GhostTestContainer with manual UI
- Visual testing through browser interaction
- Testing implementation details
- Complex manual test orchestration

### After (~200 lines)

- Standard Vitest tests
- Automated assertions
- Testing user behavior
- CI/CD compatible

## Coverage Goals

- Core functionality: 80%+ coverage
- Critical paths: 100% coverage
- UI interactions: Tested via E2E (future)

## Future Improvements

1. Add Playwright for E2E testing
2. Upgrade to Svelte 5-compatible testing library when available
3. Add visual regression testing for critical UI components
4. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline

## Known Issues

- **Svelte 5 Compatibility**: Current @testing-library/svelte doesn't fully support Svelte 5's new compilation model
- **Workaround**: Focus on testing logic separately from components until library updates

## Benefits Achieved

- ✅ 90% reduction in test code (3,200 → ~200 lines)
- ✅ Standard tooling that developers expect
- ✅ Faster test execution
- ✅ Easier maintenance
- ✅ CI/CD ready
