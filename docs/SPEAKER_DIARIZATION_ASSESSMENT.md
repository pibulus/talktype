# Speaker Diarization Assessment for TalkType

## üéØ What is Speaker Diarization?
Speaker diarization answers "who spoke when" - it segments audio by different speakers and assigns labels like "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2", etc.

## üìä Complexity Assessment

### Required Components:

1. **Speaker Embeddings Model** (~10-50MB)
   - Extracts voice fingerprints
   - Options:
     - Pyannote (Python-based, server-side)
     - WeSpeaker (ONNX models available)
     - SpeechBrain (has ONNX exports)

2. **Clustering Algorithm**
   - Groups similar voice embeddings
   - Options:
     - Spectral clustering
     - Agglomerative clustering
     - Online clustering for real-time

3. **Voice Activity Detection** ‚úÖ (Already have this!)
   - Silero VAD already implemented

### üöß Implementation Challenges:

#### **High Complexity:**
1. **No Browser-Ready Solutions**
   - Most diarization models are Python-based (pyannote, speechbrain)
   - Few ONNX models available for browsers
   - Would need to port or find alternatives

2. **Computational Requirements**
   - Embedding extraction is CPU-intensive
   - Clustering adds significant overhead
   - Real-time diarization very challenging

3. **Model Size**
   - Speaker embedding models: 10-50MB additional
   - Total with Whisper: 30-200MB models

4. **Accuracy Issues in Browser**
   - Need high-quality embeddings (hard in browser)
   - Overlapping speech is very difficult
   - Background noise affects clustering

### ‚úÖ What We Could Do (Realistic):

#### **Option 1: Simple Speaker Change Detection** (2-3 days)
```javascript
// Detect when speaker changes, not WHO is speaking
class SimpleSpeakerChange {
  detectChanges(audio) {
    // Use acoustic features (pitch, energy, spectral)
    // Mark transitions between speakers
    return [
      { time: 0, label: "Speaker A" },
      { time: 15.2, label: "Speaker B" },
      { time: 28.5, label: "Speaker A" }
    ];
  }
}
```

#### **Option 2: Basic 2-Speaker Diarization** (1 week)
- Assume max 2 speakers (interview/conversation)
- Use simple acoustic features
- Binary classification approach
- ~70% accuracy expected

#### **Option 3: Server-Side Processing** (Best quality)
- Send audio to server with pyannote
- Get back speaker segments
- 90%+ accuracy
- But requires backend infrastructure

### üî¨ Technical Implementation Path:

```javascript
// Potential implementation structure
class SpeakerDiarization {
  constructor() {
    this.embeddingModel = null; // Would need ONNX model
    this.clusterer = new SpectralClustering();
  }
  
  async process(audio) {
    // 1. VAD to get speech segments ‚úÖ (have this)
    const vad = await sileroVAD.detectVoiceActivity(audio);
    
    // 2. Extract embeddings for each segment
    const embeddings = await this.extractEmbeddings(vad.segments);
    
    // 3. Cluster embeddings
    const speakers = this.clusterer.fit(embeddings);
    
    // 4. Assign speaker labels
    return this.assignSpeakers(vad.segments, speakers);
  }
}
```

### üìà Effort vs Value Analysis:

| Approach | Effort | Quality | Value | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|---------|-------|----------------|
| No diarization | 0 | N/A | Current | ‚úÖ Keep for now |
| Speaker change detection | 2-3 days | 60% | Medium | ü§î Maybe |
| Basic 2-speaker | 1 week | 70% | Medium | ‚ùå Too much work |
| Full diarization | 2+ weeks | 80% | High | ‚ùå Too complex |
| Server-side | 3-4 days | 95% | High | ‚ùå Needs backend |

## üéØ Recommendation:

### Short Term (Now):
**Skip speaker diarization** - The complexity doesn't justify the value for TalkType's current use case. VAD alone gives us 80% of the benefit.

### Medium Term (If needed):
**Simple speaker change detection** - Could add basic "new speaker" markers without identifying WHO. This would help with:
- Meeting transcriptions
- Interview formatting
- Conversation structure

### Long Term (If TalkType scales):
**Server-side diarization** - If we need professional-quality speaker identification:
- Use pyannote on backend
- Cache results
- Offer as premium feature

## üí° Alternative: Use Formatting Cues

Instead of true diarization, we could:
1. Let users manually mark speaker changes
2. Use paragraph breaks as speaker hints
3. Add a "conversation mode" with turn-taking UI
4. Simple voice pitch detection for male/female distinction

## Summary:

**Complexity: HIGH** üî¥
- No good browser-ready models
- Significant engineering effort
- Performance overhead
- Accuracy limitations

**Current Priority: LOW** 
- VAD gives immediate value ‚úÖ
- Diarization is "nice to have"
- Better to focus on core transcription quality

**Decision: POSTPONE** 
Focus on making transcription blazing fast with VAD. Revisit diarization only if users specifically request it.
