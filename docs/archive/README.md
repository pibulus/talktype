# Documentation Archive

Historical plans, prototypes, and lore live here. Treat everything inside as read-only context; the current truth is always in `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `CLEANUP_PLAN.md`.

Guidelines:
- Park new postmortems or experiments in `docs/archive/<yyyy-mm>/<topic>.md` so we can expire them together.
- When referencing an archived doc, link to it rather than resurrecting it in place.
- Prefer updating the active docs if the information still applies today.
