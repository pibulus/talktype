# Tech Debt Cleanup - Whisper Services

## Current State (Multiple Services):
We have several whisper service implementations that were created during experimentation:

1. **whisperService.js** - Original implementation
2. **whisperServiceEnhanced.js** - Added CDN support (had issues)
3. **whisperServiceFast.js** - Simplified CDN approach
4. **whisperServiceUltimate.js** âœ… - Final implementation with all features

## Recommended Cleanup:

### Keep:
- `whisperServiceUltimate.js` - The complete implementation
- `modelRegistryEnhanced.js` - Has all the Distil models
- `modelDownloader.js` - UI state management
- `audioConverter.js` - Audio utilities

### Remove (deprecated):
- `whisperService.js` - Replaced by Ultimate
- `whisperServiceEnhanced.js` - Had scope issues, replaced
- `whisperServiceFast.js` - Was temporary experiment
- `modelRegistry.js` - Replaced by Enhanced

### Parallel Download Utils:
- Keep `parallelDownloader.js` - Might use for future features
- Keep `modelSharing.js` - Cross-tab sharing is valuable

## Migration Path:
1. Update all imports to use `whisperServiceUltimate`
2. Remove deprecated files
3. Rename Ultimate to just `whisperService` for clarity
4. Update test pages to use the consolidated service
