## Instructions for Generating Icons

We've prepared everything needed to generate the PWA icons:

1. Install the Sharp image processing library:
   ```bash
   npm install sharp
   ```

2. Run the icon generation script:
   ```bash
   node generate-icons.js
   ```

3. This will generate:
   - All required PWA icons in `/static/icons/`
   - Updated favicon.png (32x32)
   - apple-touch-icon.png (180x180) for iOS
   - og-image.png (1200x630) for social sharing

The source SVG file for these icons is: `/static/talktype-icon.svg`
