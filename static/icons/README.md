# TalkType PWA Icons

Icon PNGs in this folder are exported manually from the Ghost Icon kit (Figma) or from the layered SVGs under `static/`. There are no build scripts anymore—when an icon changes, export the PNG at the correct size, drop it in this folder, and commit the file.

See `static/icons/NEXT-STEPS.md` for the canonical checklist (export order, manifest updates, install tests, etc.). This README just documents the required sizes so designers know what files belong here.

## Required Sizes

- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

Maskable, favicon, and OG-image assets live alongside these files and are produced by the same scripts.
